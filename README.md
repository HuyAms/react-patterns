# React Patterns

## Composition

The Composition and Layout Components Pattern helps to avoid the prop drilling problem and enhances the reusability of your components.

## Last Ref

The Latest Ref Pattern allows you to have a reference to the latest value of a prop, state, or callback without needing to list it in a dependency array when accessing it in a useEffect.

## Compound Component

The Compound Components Pattern enables you to provide a set of components that implicitly share state for a simple yet powerful declarative API for reusable components.

## Props Collection and Getter

The Prop Collections and Getters Pattern allows your hook to support common use cases for UI elements people build with your hook.

ðŸ‘‰ Example: [Conform - getFormProps(https://conform.guide/api/react/getFormProps)]

## State Initializer

The state initializer pattern is a way to initialize (and reset) the state of a component in a predictable way.

## State Reducer

The State Reducer Pattern inverts control over the state management of your hook and/or component to the developer using it so they can control the state changes that happen when dispatching events.
