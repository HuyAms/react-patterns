# React Patterns

## Composition

The Composition and Layout Components Pattern helps to avoid the prop drilling problem and enhances the reusability of your components.

## Last Ref

The Latest Ref Pattern allows you to have a reference to the latest value of a prop, state, or callback without needing to list it in a dependency array when accessing it in a useEffect.

## Compound Component

The Compound Components Pattern enables you to provide a set of components that implicitly share state for a simple yet powerful declarative API for reusable components.
